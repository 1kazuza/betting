# Football Betting System

Hi, I'm James from Brazil. 

Actually, I'm studying computer programming. I want to work in Data Science soon. 

This repo has files about football betting. My aim is to code betting methods for increase the volume of bets (with positive expected value). All codes are written in Python (and some SQL).
